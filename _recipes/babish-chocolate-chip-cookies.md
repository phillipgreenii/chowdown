ingredients:
- 2 sticks (16 Tbsp) Unsalted butter
- 0.5 cup white sugar
- 1.5 cups brown sugar
- 2 eggs
- 11.5 ounces all purpose flour
- .75 Tbsp kosher salt
- .5 tsp baking soda
- .75 tsp cinnamon
- Chocolate chips
- Nuts (walnuts or your favorite)
- Flaky sea salt

directions:
- Start by browning 2 sticks of unsalted butter. Once brown, place in a measuring cup and refrigerate for 1 hour or until it’s re-solidified.
- In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the butter along with ½ cup of white sugar and 1 ½ cups of brown sugar. Mix well to combine.
- Next add 2 cold eggs to the mixture, and mix to combine.
- In a separate medium bowl, whisk together 11 ½ ounces of all purpose flour, 1 Tbsp of kosher salt, ½ tsp of baking soda, and ¾ tsp of cinnamon.
- Add half of dry ingredients to the stand mixer, mix to combine, and then add the other half of the dry ingredients. This helps keep your gluten down.
- Add your chocolate chips, stir just until everything is well combined and remove dough from mixer. Place in a bowl and refrigerate for at least an hour or as long as 2 days.
- Optional: You can toast some nuts and add those to your cookie dough as well.
- Roll your cookie dough into balls and then break in half and set on cookie sheet. This will help give the cookies a rustic look. Bake in a 350°F oven for 12-17 minutes or until they’ve reached your preferred doneness. Top with a little bit of sea salt.
- Let cool for a few minutes, serve and enjoy.
