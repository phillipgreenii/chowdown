utensils:
- Vitamix blender

ingredients:
 - 1 large head of cauliflower
 - 1 white or yellow onion
 - 3-4 garlic cloves unpeeled
 - 2 tablespoons avocado oil or olive oil
 - 1 teaspoons cumin
 - 1/2 teaspoons coriander
 - salt and pepper to taste
 - 4 cups vegetable broth or more for a thinner consistency

directions:
 - Preheat your oven to 425F (220C).
 - Use a large knife to cut the cauliflower head in half through the stem, then quarters. Remove the florets from the quarters by slicing out the stem at a diagonal. Cut any large florets into small pieces.
 - Add the cauliflower florets to a baking sheet. Drizzle with avocado oil or olive oil and add the cumin, coriander, salt and pepper.
 - Use your hands to mix everything together on the baking tray.
 - Slice the onion in half, leaving on the outer skin. Rub a little oil on the cut side, then place the onion halves cut side down on the baking sheet.
 - Use a knife to slice one end off the unpeeled garlic cloves. This just makes it easier to squish them out after they've baked. Lay them on a piece of aluminum foil, drizzle with a little oil and wrap them in the foil.
 - Place the baking sheet in the oven and roast for 30-35 minutes, or until the edges of the cauliflower florets start to turn golden.
 - Save a few of the prettiest florets for garnish. Then transfer the remaining cauliflower to a high-powered blender. Remove the outer skin of the onion and the garlic cloves and add to the blender as well.
 - Pour the vegetable broth into the blender. Blend on high for one minute. If you'd like a thinner consistency, just add more broth or water.
 - To serve, add the roasted cauliflower soup to a bowl and top a couple roasted cauliflower florets, toasted almond slices and fresh thyme.
