prepareTime: 20
cookTime: 30

ingredients:
- 3-4 slices bacon
- 1 small onion (diced)
- 2 cloves garlic (minced)
- 1 1/2 lbs chicken or turkey (raw or leftovers!)
- 2 small sweet potatoes (cut into 1/4 inch pieces)
- 1 lb brussel sprouts (trimmed & quartered)
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/4 tsp nutmeg
- 1 red apple (I use Gala, diced)
- 1/4 - 1/2 C chicken broth
- 1/2 C walnuts, roughly chopped
- 1/3 C dried cranberries
- 1 tsp dried thyme
- Salt & Pepper

directions:
- Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add bacon & cook until cooked through, flipping as needed. 
- Remove bacon from pan, leaving the bacon grease in the pan. Crumble & reserve the cooked bacon for later. 
- Add chopped onion to the pan with the bacon grease & saut√© until tender, (4-5 minutes). 
- Add garlic to the pan & cook for about 30 seconds. 
- Add chicken & cook until browned on both sides & cooked through, (if using raw chicken) - otherwise add leftover (cooked) chicken/turkey to pan to heat up. 
- Set aside, cover, & keep warm. 
- If the pan is dry, add an additional tablespoon oil. Add sweet potatoes, brussel sprouts, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt & pepper. Stir to combine & cook for 3-4 minutes to allow the veggies to brown. 
- Add apples & chicken broth, then cover & cook for 10-15 minutes. (Check & add more broth as needed to prevent any burning.) 
- Once the veggies are tender, stir in cooked chicken, walnuts, dried cranberries & thyme. Cook everything until is warmed through. 
- Season to taste with additional salt & pepper and serve with crumbled bacon.
