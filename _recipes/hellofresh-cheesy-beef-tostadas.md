prepareTime: 40
servings: 2

utensils:
- 1 large pan
- baking sheet

ingredients:
- 1 lime
- 1 yellow onion
- 1 tablespoon southwest spice blend
- 1 [beef stock concentrate](https://www.reddit.com/r/hellofresh/comments/9l7m0c/how_much_in_a_stock_packet/)
- 1/2 cup mexican cheese blend
- 1 long green pepper
- 10 ounce ground beef
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 6 flour tortillas

directions:
- Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 450 degrees. 
- Wash and dry all produce.
- Quarter lime. Halve, core, and thinly slice green pepper into strips. Halve and peel onion; thinly slice one half. 
- Make Hot Sauce Crema and Tomato Salsa
- Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add beef, Southwest Spice, chili powder, and a few big pinches of salt. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned but not yet cooked through, 4-5 minutes.
- Once beef is browned, add green pepper, sliced onion, and a pinch of salt to pan. Cook, stirring, until veggies are tender and beef is cooked through, 5-7 minutes. Add stock concentrate and 1/4 cup water. Simmer until thickened, 1-2 minutes. Season with salt; remove pan from heat and set aside.
- Drizzle tortillas with 1 TBSP olive oil; brush or rub to coat all over. Arrange on a baking sheet in a single layer. Gently prick each tortilla in a few places with a fork. Bake on top rack, flipping halfway through, until lightly golden, 4-5 minutes per side. Watch carefully to avoid burning.
- Divide tortillas between plates; evenly sprinkle with Mexican cheese. Top with beef mixture, salsa, and crema. Serve with remaining lime wedges on the side.
