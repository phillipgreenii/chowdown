prepareTime: 35
servings: 2

utensils:
- peeler
- medium pot
- potato masher
- strainer
- 1 large bowl
- 1 large pan
- paper towl

ingredients:
- 2 sweet potato
- 1 shallot
- 1/4 ounce Cilantro
- 1 jalapeno pepper
- 6 ounce chorizo
- 1/2 cp panko breadcrumbs
- 1 Roma tomato
- 4 tablespoon sour cream
- 2 scallions
- 1 lime
- 1 tablespoon mexican spice blend
- 1/2 cup italian cheese blend
- pinches of salt
- pinches of pepper
- 8 ounce black beans (optional)

directions:
- Wash and dry all produce. Peel sweet potatoes, then cut into Â½-inch cubes. Place in a medium pot with enough salted water to cover by 1 inch. Bring to a boil, then cook until easily pierced by a knife, about 15 minutes. Drain, then return to pot and mash with potato masher or fork until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.
- While potatoes cook, drain and rinse the black beans (if used). Halve, peel, and mince shallot. Trim, then thinly slice scallions. Roughly chop cilantro. Cut lime into wedges.
- Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat (use a nonstick pan if you have one). Add chorizo, scallions, half the Mexican spice blend, and shallot. Break up meat into pieces and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. Remove from pan and transfer to a large bowl.
- Make Lime Crema and Mexican Tomato Salsa
- Add sweet potatoes, cheese, and beans (if used) to bowl with chorizo mixture and mix well to combine. Place panko in a shallow dish and season with salt, pepper, and remaining Mexican spice blend. Form sweet potato mixture into six patties. Dip in panko mixture, pressing to adhere. (If you have time, refrigerate patties for at least 1 and up to 24 hours to help them firm up.) Season patties with salt and pepper.
- Wipe out same pan with a paper towel, then heat a drizzle of oil in it over medium-high heat. Add patties to pan and cook until panko is browned, 3-5 minutes per side. Divide patties between plates. Top with crema and salsa. Sprinkle with remaining cilantro. Serve with any remaining lime wedges.
